It behaves almost the same way as the actual ActivatedRoute, exposing a snapshot\nand observables for the params, query params etc., which are kept in sync.\nIn addition, this stub allows simulating a navigation by changing the params, the query params, the fragment, etc.\nWhen that happens, the snapshot is modified, then the relevant observables emit the new values.\nThere are some things that don't really work the same way as the real ActivatedRoute though:\n\nthe handling of the firstChild and of the children is entirely under the tester's responsibility. Setting the parent\nof a route stub does not add this route to the children of its parent, for example.\nwhen changing the params, query params, fragment, etc., their associated observable emits unconditionally, instead of\nfirst checking if the value is actually different from before. It's thus the responsibility of the tester to not\nchange the values if they're the same as before.\nthe params, paramMap, queryParams and queryParamMap objects of the route snapshot change when params or query params are set\non the stub route.

If an option is undefined or null, it's ignored. Except for fragment, which is only\nignored if it's undefined, because null is a valid value for a fragment.\nThe non-ignored values are used to change the snapshot of the route. Once the snapshot has been modified,\nthe observables corresponding to the updated parts emit the new value.\nSo, setting params and query params will make the params and queryParams observables emit, but not the fragment, data and\nurl observables for example. This is consistent to how the router behaves.\nNote: since the title of a route can become undefined, in order to be able to distinguish between a navigation which leaves the title\nas it is and a navigation that sets the title to undefined, a wrapper object is used for the title. So\n\ntriggerNavigation({ params:... }) leaves the title as is because it's undefined in the options\ntriggerNavigation({ title: { value: 'test' } }) sets the title to 'test'\ntriggerNavigation({ title: { value: undefined } }) sets the title to undefined\n\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n

It behaves almost the same way as the actual ActivatedRoute, exposing a snapshot\n * and observables for the params, query params etc., which are kept in sync.\n *\n * In addition, this stub allows simulating a navigation by changing the params, the query params, the fragment, etc.\n * When that happens, the snapshot is modified, then the relevant observables emit the new values.\n *\n * There are some things that don't really work the same way as the real ActivatedRoute though:\n * - the handling of the firstChild and of the children is entirely under the tester's responsibility. Setting the parent\n *   of a route stub does not add this route to the children of its parent, for example.\n * - when changing the params, query params, fragment, etc., their associated observable emits unconditionally, instead of\n *   first checking if the value is actually different from before. It's thus the responsibility of the tester to not\n *   change the values if they're the same as before.\n * - the params, paramMap, queryParams and queryParamMap objects of the route snapshot change when params or query params are set\n *   on the stub route.

What about DRY?\n});ngx-speculoos allows writing the above tests in a simpler, cleaner way:\n\nby using the page object pattern (which is optional, but recommended), you avoid repetitions.\nby using wrappers around elements, dispatching events and triggering change detection is automatic.\nby using wrappers around elements, you get useful additional methods to make tests easier to write and read.\nby using custom matchers, you get even simpler expectations and more readable error messages\nin any case you need them, you always have access to the fixture, the native elements, the debug elements, etc.\n\nExample :class MyComponentTester extends ComponentTester {\n  constructor() {\n    super(MyComponent);\n  }\n  \n  get country() {\n    return this.select('#country'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any. Similar methods exist for inputs, buttons, etc.\n  }\n  \n  get city() {\n    return this.select('#city'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any\n  }\n}\n\n[...]\n\nit('should display French cities when selecting the country France', () => {\n  tester.country.selectLabel('France'); // no dispatchEvent, no detectChanges needed\n  \n  expect(tester.city.optionValues).toEqual(['', 'PARIS', 'LYON']);\n  expect(tester.city.optionLabels).toEqual(['', 'Paris', 'Lyon']);\n});\n\nit('should hide cities when selecting empty country option', () => {\n  tester.country.selectIndex(0); // no repetition of the selector, no dispatchEvent, no detectChanges needed\n  \n  expect(tester.city).toBeFalsy(); // no repetition of the selector\n});Installation\nUsing the CLI: ng add ngx-speculoos\nUsing npm: npm install --save-dev ngx-speculoos\nUsing yarn: yarn add --dev ngx-speculoos\nGetting started\n\nimport ComponentTester, and other needed classes from ngx-speculoos\nCreate a MyComponentTester class (in your my-component.spec.ts file, typically) extending\nComponentTester, as shown above.\nExpose getters (or methods, if you prefer) returning the elements used in your tests, using\none of the ComponentTester methods (element, elements, input, select, textarea, button, etc.).\nSee the API documentation for details\nWrite your tests, as shown above, benefiting from the additional methods on the TestXxx classes.\nIf needed, you can always get the fixture, componentInstance, debugElement, nativeElement, etc.\nfrom the ComponentTester, and the nativeElement from each TestXxx wrapper.\nIf you like our custom matchers, add them in a beforeEach block as shown above, and enjoy.\nYou can also add them for all tests at once by adding the beforeEach block to the CLI-generated test.ts file.\n\nFeatures in details\nComponentTester\nThis is the entry point for most of the functionalities of ngx-speculoos. It wraps a ComponentFixture.\nYou can simply create one in your tests using\nExample :const tester = new ComponentTester(MyComponent);and then use it to query for sub elements, components, directives, etc. But we recommend adopting the\npage object pattern, in order to make your test easier to write and read, and to avoid repeating the\nsame selectors over and over again.\nYou do that by writing a class that extends ComponentTester, and provides getters (or functions)\nto query for elements, components, etc.\nExample :class MyComponentTester extends ComponentTester {\n  constructor() {\n    super(MyComponent);\n  }\n  \n  get country() {\n    return this.select('#country'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any. Similar methods exist for inputs, buttons, etc.\n  }\n  \n  get city() {\n    return this.select('#city'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any\n  }\n}and then in your tests, or in your beforeEach, once you've configured the testing module, you create\nan instance of your component tester.\nExample :describe('My component', () => {\n  let tester: MyComponentTester;\n  \n  beforeEach(() => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      declarations: [MyComponent],\n      ...\n    });\n    \n    tester = new MyComponentTester();\n    tester.change();\n  });\n  \n  it('should ...', () => {\n    \n  });Automatic change detection\nThe future of Angular is zoneless. Without ZoneJS, components have to make sure to properly notify\nAngular that they must be checked for changes, typically by updating signals.\nInstead of imperatively triggering change detections in tests, it's thus a better idea to let\nAngular decide if change detection must be run, in order to spot bugs where the component doesn't\nproperly handle its state changes.\nThis can be done by:\n\nadding a provider in the testing module to configure the fixtures to be in automatic mode\nawaiting the component fixture stability when the test thinks that a change detection should\nautomatically happen.\n\nWhen the provideAutomaticChangeDetection() provider is added, the ComponentTester will run in\nautomatic mode. In this mode, calling detectChanges() throws an error, because you should always\nlet Angular decide if change detection is necessary.\nHere's an example of a test that uses this technique:\nExample :class AppComponentTester extends ComponentTester {\n  constructor() {\n    super(AppComponent);\n  }\n\n  get incrementButton() {\n    return this.button('button');\n  }\n\n  get count() {\n    return this.element('#count');\n  }\n}\n\ndescribe('AppComponent', () => {\n  let tester: AppComponentTester;\n\n  beforeEach(async () => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      providers: [\n        provideComponentFixtureAutoDetection(),\n        provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection() // if you already uses zoneless also add this provider\n      ]\n    });\n\n    jasmine.addMatchers(speculoosMatchers);\n    \n    tester = new AppComponentTester();\n    // a first call to change() is necessary to let Angular run its first change detection\n    await tester.change();\n  });\n\n  it('should display the counter value and increment it', async () => {\n    expect(tester.count).toHaveText('0');\n    \n    // this clicks the button and then lets Angular decide if a CD is necessary, and waits until\n    // the DOM has been updated (or not)\n    await tester.incrementButton.click();\n    \n    expect(tester.count).toHaveText('1');\n  });\n});In automatic mode, your test functions should be async, and each action you do with the elements\n(click(), dispatchEvent, etc.) should be awaited.\nQueries\nQueries for elements\nMost of the queries that ngx-speculoos supports are used to query for DOM elements. The queries, however,\ndon't actually returns native DOM elements, but wrappers around them, which are instances of TestElement.\nTestElement has more specialized subclasses: TestHtmlElement, TestInput, TestSelect, TestTextarea, TestButton.\nThose subclasses offer helpful methods to get information or dispatch events to HTML elements, inputs, selects, etc.\nOur custom matchers act on those TestElement objects.\nYou can create your own subclasses of TestElement and query for them, too.\nA TestElement is a wrapper around an Angular DebugElement. So it can access the DebugElement and the\nnative DOM element that it wraps. It also has an instance of the ComponentTester which created it,\nwhich itself wraps the Angular ComponentFixture and thus allows detecting changes automatically after\nan element has been dispatched, for example.\nCSS and Type selectors\nThe first kind of query uses CSS selectors. This is simply a wrapper around Angular's DebugElement.query(By.css()).\nThe second kind of query uses directive types. This is simply a wrapper around Angular's DebugElement.query(By.directive()).\nWhatever the kind of selector you choose, the methods are the same though:\n\nelement(selector) to get the first element matching the selector\nelements(selector) to get an array of elements matching the selector\n\nBoth of those methods will automatically return a TestInput, or a TestSelect, or any other TestElement\nsubclass that ngx-speculoos provides based on the actual type of element being matched. But if you know\nin advance what the result of the query is, you can use more-specific methods, or their generic parameter.\nPassing an HTML element name as selector also automatically returns the right type\n\ninput(selector) returns a TestInput\ntextarea(selector) returns a TestTextarea\nselect(selector) returns a TestSelect\nbutton(selector) returns a TestButton\nelement(selector) returns a TestInput\nelement(selector) returns a TestHtmlElement\nelements(selector) returns an Array\nelement('input') returns a TestInput\n\nQueries for sub components\nIt's often useful to get the component instance of a sub component, for example to inspect its state,\nor to make one of its outputs emit something. You can do that using the component and components\nmethods:\nExample :get productIcon() {\n  return this.component(ProductIconComponent); // returns a ProductIconComponent \n}\n\nget reviewers() {\n  return this.components(ReviewerComponent); // returns an Array \n}Queries for injection tokens\nQuerying using element(DatepickerDirective) will return you a TestElement on which the\nDatepickerDirective has been applied.\nIf you need to get the Datepicker directive instance itself, then use the token() method\n(or tokens() to get several of them)\nwhich takes a selector (CSS or type) as first argument, and the token as second argument:\nExample :get datepicker() {\n  return this.token('#birth-date', DatepickerDirective); // returns a DatepickerDirective instance\n}Queries for custom TestElement\nWe provide TestInput, TestSelect, etc. to easily inspect or interact with inputs and selects in our tests.\nBut what if you want the same kind of test abstraction for your own reusable components or directives, like\nfor example your DatepickerDirective.\nYou can create your own TestElement subclass for that. This subclass must have a constructor that\ntakes a ComponentTester as first argument, and a DebugElement as second argument.\nExample :class TestDatepicker extends TestHtmlElement {\n  constructor(tester: ComponentTester, debugElement: DebugElement) {\n    super(tester, debugElement);\n  }\n\n  get inputField() {\n    return this.input('input');\n  }\n\n  async setDate(year: number, month: number, day: number) {\n    await this.inputField.fillWith(`${year}-${month}-${day}`);\n  }\n\n  async toggleDropdown() {\n    await this.button('button').click();\n  }\n}Once you have created that class, you can use the custom() and customs() methods, using any selector,\nto get instances of your custom `TestElement``\nExample :get birthDate() {\n  return this.custom('#birth-date', TestDatepicker);\n}Example :it('should not save if birth date is in the future', () =>) {\n  // ...\n  tester.birthDate.setDate(2200, 1, 1);\n  tester.save.click();\n  expect(userService.create).not.toHaveBenCalled();\n});or, in automatic mode\nExample :it('should not save if birth date is in the future'), async () => {\n  // ...\n  await tester.birthDate.setDate(2200, 1, 1);\n  await tester.save.click();\n  expect(userService.create).not.toHaveBenCalled();\n});Subqueries\nA query is made from the root ComponentTester. But TestElement themselves also support queries.\nSo you can query for a parent TestElement, and then use it to perform subqueries:\nExample :get cardEditButton() {\n  return this.element('.card').button('.edit');\n}\n\nget cardReviewerComponent() {\n  return this.element('.card').component(ReviewerComponent);\n}Custom Jasmine matchers\nWe provide custom matchers, that act on TestElement and on its more specific subclasses (TestInput, TestSelect, etc.).\nThe complete matcher list includes:\n\ntoHaveClass(className: string)\ntoHaveValue(value: string)\ntoHaveText(textContent: string)\ntoHaveTrimmedText(textContent: string)\ntoContainText(textContent: string)\ntoBeChecked()\ntoHaveSelectedIndex(index: number)\ntoHaveSelectedValue(value: string)\ntoHaveSelectedLabel(label: string)\ntoBeVisible()\n\nThese matchers must be installed in each test using them:\nExample :beforeEach(() => jasmine.addMatchers(speculoosMatchers));or in all tests, by adding the above line of code in the test.ts file.\nDispatching events\nTestElement provides two methods that allow dispatching events in a simple way.\n\ndispatchEvent(event: Event)\ndispatchEventOfType(type: string)\n\nGoing through these methods automatically calls detectChanges() on the ComponentTester after the event has been dispatched,\nso you don't need to call that yourself.\nThe TestElement subclasses that we provide have more specific event dispatching methods.\nFor example\n\nTestHtmlElement.click()\nTestInput.fillWith() for text, password, number, etc.\nTestInput.check() for radios and checkboxes\nTestInput.uncheck() for checkboxes\nTestTextarea.fillWith()\nTestSelect.selectIndex()\nTestSelect.selectValue()\nTestSelect.selectLabel()\n\nCreating your own TestElement subclasses is a good way to provide such custom methods to interact\nwith your own reusable components in tests.\nRouting helpers\nActivatedRoute stub\nThe library provides a stub for the ActivatedRoute class that you typically inject in your routed components.\nIt mimics the behavior of the actual ActivatedRoute, by having a snapshot and observables that emit when this\nsnapshot changes. And it also allows simulating navigations by imperatively changing the parameters, query parameters,\netc.\nExample :import { ActivatedRouteStub } from 'ngx-speculoos';\n\nclass RoutingComponentTester extends ComponentTester {\n  // ...\n}\n\ndescribe('routing component', () => {\n  let route: ActivatedRouteStub;\n  let tester: RoutingComponentTester;\n  \n  beforeEach(() => {\n    route = stubRoute({\n      params: { categoryId: 'pets' }\n    });\n    \n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      declarations: [RoutingComponent],\n      providers: [\n        { provide: ActivatedRoute, useValue: route }\n      ]\n    });\n    \n    tester = new RoutingComponentTester();\n    tester.detectChanges();\n  });\n  \n  it('should display all the products of the category', () => {\n    // test based on the initial route state\n  });\n\n  it('should load other products when the category changes or when the query changes', () => {\n    route.setParam('category', 'toys');\n    tester.detectChanges();\n    // ...\n\n    route.setQueryParams({ 'max-price': '30', target: 'children' });\n    tester.detectChanges();\n    // ...\n  });\n});RoutingTester\nAn alternative approach to injecting a stub activated route consists in using the Angular RouterTestingHarness.\nThe library helps using it by providing a RoutingTester, which is a ComponentTester wrapping the\nRouterTestingHarness in addition to wrapping its fixture, and additionally provides helper properties.\nHere's an example usage of a component displaying the value of the query parameter 'page' and allowing\nto navigate to itself with a different value for that query parameter.\nExample :class PageComponentTester extends RoutingTester {\n  constructor(harness: RouterTestingHarness) {\n    super(harness);\n  }\n\n  get title() {\n    return this.element('h1');\n  }\n\n  get link() {\n    return this.element('a');\n  }\n}\n\ndescribe('RoutingTester', () => {\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      providers: [\n        provideRouter([\n          { path: 'list', component: PageComponent }\n        ])\n      ]\n    });\n  });\n\n  it('should display the page of the query params', async () => {\n    const tester = new PageComponentTester(await RouterTestingHarness.create('/list?page=42'));\n\n    expect(tester.title).toHaveText('Current page: 42');\n\n    await tester.harness.navigateByUrl('/list?page=54');\n\n    expect(tester.title).toHaveText('Current page: 54');\n  });\n\n  it('should navigate to the next page when clicking the link', async () => {\n    const tester = new PageComponentTester(await RouterTestingHarness.create('/list?page=42'));\n\n    expect(tester.title).toHaveText('Current page: 42');\n\n    tester.link.click();\n    await tester.stable();\n\n    expect(tester.urlTree.queryParamMap.get('page')).toBe('43');\n    expect(tester.url).toBe('/list?page=43');\n    expect(tester.title).toHaveText('Current page: 43');\n  });\n});\nMocking helper\nJasmine is quite verbose when creating mock objects in a typesafe way:\nExample :const productService = jasmine.createSpyObj('ProductService', ['list', 'get', 'create', 'update']);Since most of what we mock (usually Angular services) are classes, we can actually do a bit of introspection\nand create a mock that will automatically mock all the methods declared in the class. That's what our\ncreateMock() function does. The above code can thus be reduced to:\nExample :const productService = createMock(ProductService);Testing with a host component\nngx-speculoos doesn't provide any specific support for testing with host components, but we do it\na lot, simply by creating a ComponentTester for the host component rather than the component under test:\nExample :@Component({\n  template: ''\n})\nclass HostComponent {\n  user: User = {\n    id: 'u1',\n    name: 'John'\n  };\n\n  smiled = false;\n}\n\nclass HostComponentTester extends ComponentTester {\n  constructor() {\n    super(HostComponent);\n  }\n\n  get userComponent() {\n    return this.component(UserComponent);\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}Once you have that, you can access the host component using componentInstance(),\nthe component under test using userComponent(), and any element of the component under test\nusing the usual queries.\nGotchas\nWhen do I need to call change or detectChanges()?\nIn imperative mode, any event dispatched through a TestElement automatically calls detectChanges() for you.\nBut you still need to call change() or detectChanges() by yourself in the other cases:\n\nto actually initialize your component. Sometimes, you want to configure some mocks before the ngOnInit()\nmethod of your component is called. That's why creating a ComponentTester does not automatically call\ndetectChanges(). You need to do it yourself. The first call will cause the component lifecycle to start,\njust as when using a ComponentFixture directly.\nto force change detection once you've changed the state of your component without dispatching an event:\nby changing the state, or emitting an event through a subject, or triggering a navigation\nfrom the ActivatedRouteStub\n\nNote that, in imperative mode, change() calls detectChanges(). So you can call either one of the other\nwhen you want to trigger a change detection.\nIn automatic mode, any event dispatched through a TestElement automatically calls await change() for you.\nBut you still need to call await change() by yourself in the same other cases as in the imperative mode:\n\nto actually initialize your component. \nto force change detection once you've changed the state of your component without dispatching an event.\n\nCan I use the TestElement methods to act on the component element itself, rather than a sub-element?\nYes. The ComponentTester has a testElement property, which is the TestHtmlElement wrapping the component's element.\nIssues, questions\nPlease, provide feedback by filing issues, or by submitting pull requests, to the Github Project.\nComplete example\nYou can look at a minimal complete example in the demo project.\nUpgrading to v13\nVersion 13 of ngx-speculoos introduces the automatic mode, consisting in using automatic change detection\ninstead of imperatively running change detections. See the Automatic change detection\nsection above for details.\nAs a result, all the methods that used to call detectChanges() for you now return a Promise instead of returning\nvoid. In imperative mode (the default), they are in fact synchronous and call detectChanges(), just as before.\nIn automatic mode however, they call await change() and should thus be awaited.\nYour tests should generally keep compiling and running without changes. \nBut if you created custom test elements which override methods that now return a promise, and return something \nother than void, for example:\nExample :class CustomInput extends TestInput {\n  //...\n  fillWith(s: string): CustomInput {\n    super.fillWith(s);\n    return this;\n  }\n}Then that won't compile anymore.\nAnd in general, if you want your custom test element to be usable in both modes, all their method that explicitly\nor indirectly called detectChanges() should now return a promise and explicitly of indirectly call await change().\nFor example:\nExample :class CustomInput extends TestHtmlElement {\n  //...\n  async fillInput(s: string): Promise {\n    await this.element('input').fillWith(s);\n    // ...\n  }\n  \n  async clickButton(): Promise {\n    await this.element('button').click();\n    // ...\n  } \n  \n  async changeState(): Promise {\n    this.component(Foo).doSomething();\n    await this.change();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Ninja Squad\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
