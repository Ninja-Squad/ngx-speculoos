It's thus the responsibility of the tester to not\nchange the values if they're the same as before.\n\n\n            \n\n            \n                Extends\n            \n            \n                        ActivatedRoute\n            \n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        Methods\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                setData\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                setDataItem\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                setFragment\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                setParam\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                setParams\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                setQueryParam\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                setQueryParams\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                setUrl\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                toString\n                            \n                            \n                                    Public\n                                triggerNavigation\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        \n                            Accessors\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    root\n                                \n                                \n                                    pathFromRoot\n                                \n                                \n                                    firstChild\n                                \n                                \n                                    children\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n        \n    \n\n\n            \n    Constructor\n        \n            \n                \n                    \nconstructor(options?: ActivatedRouteStubOptions)\n                    \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                Defined in src/lib/route.ts:263\n                            \n                        \n\n                \n                    \n                            Constructs a new instance, based on the given options.\nIf an option is not provided (or if no option is provided at all), then the route has a default value for this option\n(empty parameters for example, null fragment, etc.)\nIf no parent is passed, then this route has no parent and is thus set as the root.

If an option is undefined or null, it's ignored. Except for fragment, which is only\nignored if it's undefined, because null is a valid value for a fragment.\nThe non-ignored values are used to change the snapshot of the route. Once the snapshot has been modified,\nthe observables corresponding to the updated parts emit the new value.\nSo, setting params and query params will make the params and queryParams observables emit, but not the fragment, data and\nurl observables for example. This is consistent to how the router behaves.\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Name\n                                    Type\n                                    Optional\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    options\n                                    \n                                            literal type\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :         void\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n    \n        Accessors\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        root\n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        getroot()\n                    \n                \n                            \n                                \n                                    Defined in src/lib/route.ts:309\n                                \n                            \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        pathFromRoot\n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        getpathFromRoot()\n                    \n                \n                            \n                                \n                                    Defined in src/lib/route.ts:317\n                                \n                            \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        firstChild\n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        getfirstChild()\n                    \n                \n                            \n                                \n                                    Defined in src/lib/route.ts:321\n                                \n                            \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        children\n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        getchildren()\n                    \n                \n                            \n                                \n                                    Defined in src/lib/route.ts:325\n                                \n                            \n\n            \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        import { ActivatedRoute, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, convertToParamMap, Data, Params, Route, UrlSegment } from '@angular/router';\nimport { BehaviorSubject, map, Observable } from 'rxjs';\nimport { Type } from '@angular/core';\n\n/**\n * Creates a fake partial ActivatedRoute for tests.\n *\n * If you pass params, then the created route's paramMap will contain the same values.\n * The same goes for queryParams and queryParamMap.\n *\n * If you pass a parent route and a snapshot, and the passed snapshot doesn't have a parent, then the snapshot's\n * parent will be set to the parent route snapshot.

What about DRY?\n});ngx-speculoos allows writing the above tests in a simpler, cleaner way:\n\nby using the page object pattern (which is optional, but recommended), you avoid repetitions. \nby using wrappers around elements, dispatching events and triggering change detection is automatic.\nby using wrappers around elements, you get useful additional methods to make tests easier to write and read.\nby using custom matchers, you get even simpler expectations and more readable error messages\nin any case you need them, you always have access to the fixture, the native elements, the debug elements, etc.\n\nclass MyComponentTester extends ComponentTester {\n  constructor() {\n    super(MyComponent);\n  }\n  \n  get country() {\n    return this.select('#country'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any. Similar methods exist for inputs, buttons, etc.\n  }\n  \n  get city() {\n    return this.select('#city'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any\n  }\n}\n\n[...]\n\nit('should display French cities when selecting the country France', () => {\n  tester.country.selectLabel('France'); // no dispatchEvent, no detectChanges needed\n  \n  expect(tester.city.optionValues).toEqual(['', 'PARIS', 'LYON']);\n  expect(tester.city.optionLabels).toEqual(['', 'Paris', 'Lyon']);\n});\n\nit('should hide cities when selecting empty country option', () => {\n  tester.country.selectIndex(0); // no repetition of the selector, no dispatchEvent, no detectChanges needed\n  \n  expect(tester.city).toBeFalsy(); // no repetition of the selector\n});Custom matchers\nIf you use Jasmine, we also have custom matchers for frequent expectations:\n  beforeEach(() => jasmine.addMatchers(speculoosMatchers));\n\n  it('should contain a pre-populated form', () => {\n    expect(tester.informationMessage).toContainText('Please check that everything is correct');\n    expect(tester.country).toHaveSelectedValue('FR');\n    expect(tester.city).toHaveSelectedLabel('Paris');\n    expect(tester.name).toHaveValue('Doe');\n    expect(tester.newsletter).toBeChecked();\n  });The complete matcher list includes:\n\ntoHaveClass(className: string)\ntoHaveValue(value: string)\ntoHaveText(textContent: string)\ntoContainText(textContent: string)\ntoBeChecked()\ntoHaveSelectedIndex(index: number)\ntoHaveSelectedValue(value: string)\ntoHaveSelectedLabel(label: string)\ntoBeVisible()\n\nInstallation\nUsing the CLI: ng add ngx-speculoos\nUsing npm: npm install --save-dev ngx-speculoos\nUsing yarn: yarn add --dev ngx-speculoos\nGetting started\n\nimport ComponentTester, and other needed classes from ngx-speculoos\nCreate a MyComponentTester class (in your my-component.spec.ts file, typically) extending \nComponentTester, as shown above.\nExpose getters (or methods, if you prefer) returning the elements used in your tests, using\none of the ComponentTester methods (element, elements, input, select, textarea, button).\nSee the API documentation for details\nWrite your tests, as shown above, benefitting from the additional methods on the TestXxx classes.\nIf needed, you can always get the fixture, componentInstance, debugElement, nativeElement, etc.\nfrom the ComponentTester, and the nativeElement from each TestXxx wrapper.\nIf you like our custom matchers, add them in a beforeEach block as shown above, and enjoy.\nYou can also add them for all tests at once by adding the beforeEach to block the CLI-generated test.ts file.\n\nIssues, questions\nPlease, provide feedback by filing issues, or by submitting pull requests, to the Github Project.\nComplete example\nYou can look at a minimal complete example in the demo project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Ninja Squad\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
