It also provides utilities to make writing Angular unit tests.\nThe library simply wraps the standard Angular ComponentFixture, and you should thus be \nable to understand and start using ngx-speculoos in just a few minutes if you already know\nhow to write Angular unit tests.\nWhy should you care?\nIf you've ever written tests like the following:\nit('should display French cities when selecting the country France', () => {\n  const countrySelect = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('#country'); // countrySelect is of type any\n  countrySelect.selectedIndex = 12; // what is at index 12?\n  countrySelect.dispatchEvent(new Event('change')); // why do I need to do that?\n  fixture.detectChanges();\n\n  const city = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('#city'); // city is of type any\n  expect(city).toBeTruthy();\n  expect(city.options.length).toBe(3);\n  expect(city.options[0].value).toBe('');\n  expect(city.options[0].label).toBe('');\n  expect(city.options[1].value).toBe('PARIS');\n  expect(city.options[1].label).toBe('Paris');\n  expect(city.options[2].value).toBe('LYON');\n  expect(city.options[2].label).toBe('Lyon');\n});\n\nit('should hide cities when selecting the empty country option', () => {\n  const countrySelect = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('#country'); // I did that previously. What about DRY?\n  countrySelect.selectedIndex = 0;\n  countrySelect.dispatchEvent(new Event('change')); // why do I need to do that?\n  fixture.detectChanges(); // why do I need to do that?\n\n  expect(fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('#city')).toBeFalsy(); // I did that previously. What about DRY?\n});ngx-speculoos allows writing the above tests in a simpler, cleaner way:\n\nby using the page object pattern (which is optional, but recommended), you avoid repetitions. \nby using wrappers around elements, dispatching events and triggering change detection is automatic.\nby using wrappers around elements, you get useful additional methods to make tests easier to write and read.\nby using custom matchers, you get even simpler expectations and more readable error messages\nin any case you need them, you always have access to the fixture, the native elements, the debug elements, etc.\n\nclass MyComponentTester extends ComponentTester {\n  constructor() {\n    super(MyComponent);\n  }\n\n  get country() {\n    return this.select('#country'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any. Similar methods exist for inputs, buttons, etc.\n  }\n\n  get city() {\n    return this.select('#city'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any\n  }\n}\n\n[...]\n\nit('should display French cities when selecting the country France', () => {\n  tester.country.selectLabel('France'); // no dispatchEvent, no detectChanges needed\n\n  expect(tester.city.optionValues).toEqual(['', 'PARIS', 'LYON']);\n  expect(tester.city.optionLabels).toEqual(['', 'Paris', 'Lyon']);\n});\n\nit('should hide cities when selecting empty country option', () => {\n  tester.country.selectIndex(0); // no repetition of the selector, no dispatchEvent, no detectChanges needed\n\n  expect(tester.city).toBeFalsy(); // no repetition of the selector\n});If you use Jasmine, we also have custom matchers for frequent expectations:\n  beforeEach(() => jasmine.addMatchers(speculoosMatchers));\n\n  it('should contain a pre-populated form', () => {\n    expect(tester.informationMessage).toContainText('Please check that everything is correct');\n    expect(tester.country).toHaveSelectedValue('FR');\n    expect(tester.city).toHaveSelectedLabel('Paris');\n    expect(tester.name).toHaveValue('Doe');\n    expect(tester.newsletter).toBeChecked();\n  });Installation\nUsing npm: npm install --save-dev ngx-speculoos\nUsing yarn: yarn add --dev ngx-speculoos\nGetting started\n\nimport ComponentTester, and other needed classes from ngx-speculoos\nCreate a MyComponentTester class (in your my-component.spec.ts file, typically) extending \nComponentTester, as shown above.\nExpose getters (or methods, if you prefer) returning the elements used in your tests, using\none of the ComponentTester methods (element, elements, input, select, textarea, button).\nSee the API documentation for details\nWrite your tests, as shown above, benefitting from the additional methods on the TestXxx classes.\nIf needed, you can always get the fixture, componentInstance, debugElement, nativeElement, etc.\nfrom the ComponentTester, and the nativeElement from each TestXxx wrapper.\nIf you like our custom matchers, add them in a beforeEach block as shown above, and enjoy.\n\nIssues, questions\nPlease, provide feedback by filing issues, or by submitting pull requests, to the Github Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Ninja Squad\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
