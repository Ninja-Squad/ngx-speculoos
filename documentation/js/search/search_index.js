If a fixture is passed, then delegates to this fixture directly.\nNote that no detectChanges() call is made by this constructor. It's up to the subclass constructor,\nor to the user of the created ComponentTester, to call detectChanges() at least once to trigger change\ndetection. This is necessary because some component templates can only be evaluated once inputs\nhave been set on the component instance.\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                                    Description\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        arg\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                    Type | ComponentFixture\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                the type of the component to wrap, or a component fixture to wrap\n\n                                                        \n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n            \n    \n        \n            Properties\n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                Readonly\n                            fixture\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Type :     ComponentFixture\n\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                    Defined in src/lib/component-tester.ts:25\n                            \n                        \n\n                \n                    \n                        The component fixture of the component\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                Readonly\n                            testElement\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Type :         TestElement\n\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                    Defined in src/lib/component-tester.ts:20\n                            \n                        \n\n                \n                    \n                        The test element of the component\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n\n            \n    \n    \n        Methods\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            button\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nbutton(selector: string)\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in src/lib/component-tester.ts:129\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Gets the first button matched by the given selector.

You can thus use\ntester.elements('input') as Array.\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Name\n                                    Type\n                                    Optional\n                                    Description\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    selector\n                                    \n                                                string\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                    \n                                        a CSS selector\n\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :         Array>\n\n                    \n                    \n                        the array of matched elements, empty if no element was matched\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            input\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \ninput(selector: string)\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Inherited from         TestElement\n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                        Defined in         TestElement:97\n\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Gets the first input matched by the given selector.

It also provides utilities to make writing Angular unit tests easier.\nThe library simply wraps the standard Angular ComponentFixture, and you should thus be \nable to understand and start using ngx-speculoos in just a few minutes if you already know\nhow to write Angular unit tests.\nWhy should you care?\nIf you've ever written tests like the following:\nit('should display French cities when selecting the country France', () => {\n  const countrySelect = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('#country'); // countrySelect is of type any\n  countrySelect.selectedIndex = 12; // what is at index 12?\n  countrySelect.dispatchEvent(new Event('change')); // why do I need to do that?\n  fixture.detectChanges();\n\n  const city = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('#city'); // city is of type any\n  expect(city).toBeTruthy();\n  expect(city.options.length).toBe(3);\n  expect(city.options[0].value).toBe('');\n  expect(city.options[0].label).toBe('');\n  expect(city.options[1].value).toBe('PARIS');\n  expect(city.options[1].label).toBe('Paris');\n  expect(city.options[2].value).toBe('LYON');\n  expect(city.options[2].label).toBe('Lyon');\n});\n\nit('should hide cities when selecting the empty country option', () => {\n  const countrySelect = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('#country'); // I did that previously. What about DRY?\n  countrySelect.selectedIndex = 0;\n  countrySelect.dispatchEvent(new Event('change')); // why do I need to do that?\n  fixture.detectChanges(); // why do I need to do that?\n\n  expect(fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('#city')).toBeFalsy(); // I did that previously. What about DRY?\n});ngx-speculoos allows writing the above tests in a simpler, cleaner way:\n\nby using the page object pattern (which is optional, but recommended), you avoid repetitions. \nby using wrappers around elements, dispatching events and triggering change detection is automatic.\nby using wrappers around elements, you get useful additional methods to make tests easier to write and read.\nby using custom matchers, you get even simpler expectations and more readable error messages\nin any case you need them, you always have access to the fixture, the native elements, the debug elements, etc.\n\nclass MyComponentTester extends ComponentTester {\n  constructor() {\n    super(MyComponent);\n  }\n\n  get country() {\n    return this.select('#country'); // returns a TestSelect object, not any.
